+ <p> Hi my name is Jacob Tongue I am a student attending Medfield Public High. It is a stressful but I am hard working. I was born on april 19 2003
+ in prince frederick maryland a usually scorching hot place found down south. Where i went to work for my mother in her spa on days we had no school but she had work. i would  help customers get to where they wanted to be  or entertain them with my 4 year old goofy self. then about within a year the apa closed due to hard tax reforms and with that we moved to live with our grandparents in mass witch means new school and new friends to be made.  later i would be helping around town through either community service or my grandfather's workshop i also help and regularly attend the baptist church too helping kids and being preached to about god. I am a friendly person  and like to creat a kind entertainment for everyone giving good vibes to all even in my most stressful days. I am hard working and determined to do well in school. I struggle at points but know i will seek help knowing all my tools I have through school facuty and staff. I hope u know a little more about me and know I would love to learn more about you.
